# multi-cpp-project

Simple template for C++ projects that require building several targets (with same dependencies)

## How-to

Run `./build.sh` to build, edit the `CMakeLists.txt` to add libs etc.

## Adding a target

Simply add a folder named `src__*` and it will be automatically built along the others.
